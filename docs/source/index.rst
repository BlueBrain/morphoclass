Morphology-Classification
=========================
MorphoClass is a python package that provides machine learning based tools for morphology
type recognition of neuron reconstructions.

Solutions for both supervised and unsupervised
learning are provided, as well as an ecosystem for data handling, transformation, and
augmentation, training, visualisation, and tools for explainable AI. The main focus
of machine learning models is on graph neural networks, but other solution can also benefit
from the provided ecosystem.
