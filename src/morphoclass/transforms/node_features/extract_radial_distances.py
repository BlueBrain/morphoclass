    The data should contain the field `tmd_neuron`, see the

    For each apical tree in the neuron the radial distance of all node points
    of the morphology are extracted and added to the feature vector.

    The radial distance of a given node is the distance to the root point of
    the tree that is measured by drawing a straight line.

    Parameters
    ----------
    negative_ipcs : bool
        Invert sign for features of IPCs. ee documentation of the
        `ExtractDistances` base class for more details.
    negative_bpcs : bool
        Invert sign for features of lower apical trees of BPCs. ee documentation
        of the `ExtractDistances` base class for more details.
