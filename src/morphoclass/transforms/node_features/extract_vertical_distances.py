class ExtractVerticalDistances(ExtractDistances):
    """Extract vertical distance features from apical trees.

    The data should contain the field `tmd_neuron`, see the
    `ExtractTMDNeuron` class.

    For each apical tree in the neuron the vertical distance of all node points
    of the morphology are extracted and added to the feature vector.

    The vertical distance of a given node is the distance to the root point of
    the tree that is measured by following the graph edges, and projecting onto
    a given axis. The default axis is 'y'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertical_axis : str
        Axis along which the neuron is assumed to be oriented vertically. See
        documentation of the `ExtractDistances` base class for more details.
    negative_ipcs : bool
        Invert sign for features of IPCs. ee documentation of the
        `ExtractDistances` base class for more details.
    negative_bpcs : bool
        Invert sign for features of lower apical trees of BPCs. ee documentation
        of the `ExtractDistances` base class for more details.
