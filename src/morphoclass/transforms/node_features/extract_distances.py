class ExtractDistances:
    """Extract some distance features from apical trees.

    The data should contain the field `tmd_neuron`, see the
    `ExtractTMDNeuron` class.

    This is an abstract class. Sub-classes of this class should implement
    `get_distance(apical)` to implement concrete distance extraction from
    the apical tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertical_axis : str
        The name of the axis along which the neurons are vertically oriented.
        In other words, the axis that is perpendicular to the cortex surface.
        This is only relevant for BPCs and is only considered if the parameter
        `negative_bpcs` is true, in which case the projection of the two apicals
        onto this axis decides which one of the two is lower than the other one.
    negative_ipcs : bool
        If true then the distance features of all cells labelled as IPCs will
        have their sign inverted (feature => -feature).
    negative_bpcs : bool
        If true then all cells labelled as BPCs will have their lower apical's
        distance features inverted by flipping their sign. (feature => -feature).
        To determine which of the two apicals is lower the node positions are
        projected onto the axis specified in `vertical_axis`.
