        <p>
            Every morphology subclass has a good representative and a bad representative.
            They are defined based on the model probability. The probability model thinks this sample belongs to the expert label (ground-truth).
            The good representative is the sample with the highest probability. The bad representative is the sample with the lowest probability.
            We implement several techniques for explaining these samples.
            The content table below shows the ones that are covered in this report.
            Each of the techniques iterates through subclasses and then through good and bad representative.
            An example: if good and bad samples have both high probability of belong to an expert class, this means the model agrees with the expert labels.
