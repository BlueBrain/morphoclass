    plots are generated for model trained on all data, as well as for
    individual cross-validation splits.

    The report contains renderings of morphologies that were flagged as
    outliers by CleanLab. Each morphology is rendered as a front and side
    view along with a plot if the corresponding persistence image and
    diagram. CleanLab produces a label confidence score as well as
    probabilities for the morphology to have each of the other labels. These
    scores are included in the outlier report.
