    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : morphoclass.data.MorphologyDataset
        A dataset.
    feature_extractor :
        A node feature extractor from `morphoclass.transforms`.
    n_features : int or list or tuple
        The number of features `feature_extractor` extracts. Must be
        provided if `feature_extractor` is not None.
    fitted_scaler :
        The feature scaler. If None then a new scaler will be fitted.
        Typical use case: use None for the training set to fit a new
        scaler, then re-used this scaler for the validation set.
    scaler_cls : str
        Only used of `fitted_scaler` is None. In this case a new scaler
        of this class will be fitted.
    edge_weight : int or None

        included in the overall transform.

    Returns
    -------
    transform
        The overall transform.
    fitted_scaler
        The fitted scaler that is part of the overall transform. Useful
        when it need to be re-used, for example for a validation set.

    The split is prepared by constructing subsets using the train

    We have to distinguish between datasets with
    IPCs/HPSs and other datasets. The former have to use
    projections of the coordinates onto the y-axis as features,
    the latter the usual radial distances.

    In other words, L2 and L6 have to use projections, the layers
    L3, L4, and L5 radial distances.

    Note that it is assumed that the apicals are already correctly oriented,
    otherwise the projection features won't work correctly. The best way
