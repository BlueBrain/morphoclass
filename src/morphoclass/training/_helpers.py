    For a given seed the generated results will always

    While the validation indices might be sorted, the
    training indices are randomly permuted. Therefore
    it is not necessary to shuffle the samples at
    training time any more.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int
        The number of splits in the k-fold
    labels : list_like
        The labels upon which to generate splits.
    seed : int
        A random seed to ensure determinism.

    Returns
    -------
    folds : list
        A list of length `n_splits` containing tuples of the
        form `(train_idx, val_idx)`.
