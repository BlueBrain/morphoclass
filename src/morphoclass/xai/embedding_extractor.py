class EmbeddingExtractor:
    """Extract inputs/outputs from a given layer.

    An instance of the embedding extractor is created by providing a model
    and a layer in that model for which the inputs and the outputs should
    be extracted.

    To obtain the inputs and the outputs call the extractor's `__call__`
    function with a batch of data, which is internally forwarded to the model.
    the `__call__` function then returns the inputs/outputs as a tuple.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : torch.nn.Module
        A torch model from which to extract intermediate activations.
    layer_name : str
        The layer in the given model for which to extract the inputs/outputs.
        The layer instance is obtained by `getattr(model, layer_name)` and
        should return an instance of `torch.nn.Module`.
